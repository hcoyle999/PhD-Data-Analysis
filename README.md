This repository will contain files from R from my PhD data analysis (clinical and cognitive data) and from matlab for my EEG and TMS-EEG data. 

R markdown files I have created so far include:

Demographics.Rmd = Script for describing and summarising demographic data and creating tables to use in Baseline paper

Clinial_data.Rmd= Script for visualising, normality testing and running preliminary analyses on my Clinical data (Mood, Post Concussion Symptoms, Fatigue and Views of Health)

Cogntive_data.Rmd = Script for visualising, normality testing and running preliminary analyses on my Cognitive data (Attention, Processing Speed, Memory, Executive Functione etc)

There are in the r_scripts folder.

In the poorly named Analysis folder are other files that include my early learning/practice with coding. Plan to fix this up!
